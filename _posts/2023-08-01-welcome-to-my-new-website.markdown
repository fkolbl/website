Welcome to my new website. Starting on September 1st 2023, I am Assistant Professor at [Bordeaux INP, ENSEIRB-Matmeca](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr/fr) in the Electrical Engineering department. I will perform my research at the [laboratory IMS](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr) in the [Bioelectronics group](https://www.ims-bordeaux.fr/research-groups/bioelectronics/).

This website is intended to present my research and teaching activities. If you are looking for teaching material related to my previous position ([CYU - IUT GEII](https://cyiut.cyu.fr/formations/le-bachelor-universitaire-de-technologie/b-u-t-genie-electrique-et-informatique-industrielle)), please contact me.
