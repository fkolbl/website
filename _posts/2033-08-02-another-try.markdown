$$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2$$

and this is a table:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

and another one

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

and some code:
```python
def say_hello(*args):
    print('hello ', args)
    return 1

if __name__='__main__':
    try: 
        say_hello('World!')
    except:
        print('Oups, something went wrong')
```
