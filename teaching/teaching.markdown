I am teaching mainly at ENSERIB-Matmeca in the Electrical Engineering department, mostly on topics related with analog electronics. I am also in charge of studies for the first year students.

Here is a list of teaching and corresponding pages for shared resources:
1. Electroncis first year (S5-S6):
    - S5 Analog Electronics labs - EANA3
    - [S5 Certificate of Mathematics - MATH0]({% link teaching/MATH0.markdown %})
    - [S5 Electromagnetism - PHYS 1]({% link teaching/PHYS1.markdown %})
    - [S6 Measurement and uncertainties - PHYS 3]({% link teaching/PHYS3.markdown %})
2. Electronics second year (S7-S8):
    - [S7 Electronics projects - PROJ 1]({% link teaching/EEL7_PROJ1.markdown %})
    - S7 Analog Electronics labs - EA208
3. Electronics third year - ESYBIO:
   - [S9 Introduction to biosignals]({% link teaching/TP_BioZ.markdown %})

Appart from that, I also enjoy sharing knowledge in general bioelectronics. For instance, the page for the Bordeaux Summer School on Cancer can be accessed at this link: [Lecture and lab on Bio-Impedance]({% link teaching/Summer_School.markdown %})
